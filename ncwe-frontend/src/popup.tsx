export const InfoPopupText = `How nginx-config-web-editor works:

1. The current nginx config at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf is copied to /etc/nginx/ncwe/default-nginx.conf (This happens only if the ncwe directory is empty)

2. You can edit, clone, delete, and update nginx configurations with the web editor

3. Clicking the "reload" button causes the currently open configuration file to replace the current config at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`;
